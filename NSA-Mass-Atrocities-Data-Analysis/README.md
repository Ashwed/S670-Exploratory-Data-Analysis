# NSA-Mass-Atrocities-Data-Analysis
The recent surge in rebel conflicts such as those by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has led to an urgent
need in examining their characteristics for policy research in politics and international relations. Armed
conflicts often take place in heavily populated areas and can significantly affect the cultural, economic and

interventions in conflict resolution, peace negotiations and humanitarian relief. Using a data driven approach,
our project aims to answer some key research questions pertaining to these nonstate actor mass atrocities
