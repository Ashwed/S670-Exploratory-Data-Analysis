# NSA-Mass-Atrocities-Data-Analysis
**Given that a non state actor commits mass atrocity, what conditions make it worse?**

The recent surge in rebel conflicts such as those by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has led to an urgent
need in examining their characteristics for policy research in politics and international relations. Armed
conflicts often take place in heavily populated areas and can significantly affect the cultural, economic and
social conditions of a region. Understanding the behavior of these groups can be of significant help to policy
interventions in conflict resolution, peace negotiations and humanitarian relief. Using a data driven approach,
our project aims to answer some key research questions pertaining to these nonstate actor mass atrocities.

### Basic Terminologies and Data Description

**Non State Actor** : In political science and international relations, a state actor is an individual or an
entity that is officially recognized or supported by a sovereign government. For example, the United States
Government or the FBI or CIA are state actors.
A non state actor is an individual or an entity which has considerable political influence but is not official
supported by a sovereign government. Notable examples of non state actors include terrorist organizations
like ISIS and Al Qaeda.
**Mass Atrocity** : There is no universally accepted definition of a mass atrocity but it generally refers to
large scale and deliberate attacks on civilian population.

### Data
The source of our data is the Non-State Actor Mass Atrocities dataset (Dataset’s Homepage) compiled by
Dr. Cyanne E. Loyle, an assistant professor at IU’s Political Science department. The dataset contains
501 observations on 36 variables related to NSA conflicts. Because there is no universally accepted definition
of NSAs, the original creator of the dataset has defined a nonstate actor as rebel groups and pro-government
militias (PGMs) only. Additionally, the dataset includes only those groups that have been formed between
1 January 1989 to 31 December 2007. Check the PDF report for more insights about the data.
